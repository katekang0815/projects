 > A central hub to view, collaborate, and comment on all cohort's projects from the 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive program. Students of the May cohort and all future cohorts that could benefit from having a website dedicated to displaying sample projects, as well as all Hack Reactor staff and alumni.

 ### Tech stack
  Django REST framework, React, Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Docker,  SimpleJWT auth

### API design
For `API endpoints` for projects in-depth, look at [API design](https://gitlab.com/salmons1/salmon-project/-/blob/main/docs/apis.md)

### External API Integrations
* [python-gitlab](https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api-usage.html)
   - Provides a access token for full list of available public resources.
   - The gitlab.Gitlab class provides managers to access the GitLab resources. Each manager provides a set of methods to act on the resources. The available methods depend on the resource type.
* [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html): 
    - Get a list of the public project can be accessed without any authentication.
    - Retrieve data from the each project for the attribute: projectId, project name, group name, group id, team members, language usage, commits distributions,started date.
