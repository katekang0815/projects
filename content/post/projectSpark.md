# ProjectSpark

A central hub to view, collaborate, and comment on all cohort's projects from the 19-week Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive program. Students of the May cohort and all future cohorts that could benefit from having a website dedicated to displaying sample projects, as well as all Hack Reactor staff and alumni.
